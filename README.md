# generalized_schema_learning

## Introduction
This project contains code to generate, run, test, and analyze generalized schema-learning experiments using data generated by [Coffee Shop World](https://github.com/PrincetonCompMemLab/narrative). These experiments accompany our [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09006).

### Coffee Shop World
We write pre-defined schemas that define a story graph, in which nodes represent story states and edge weights represent transition probabilities between states. Each traversal through the story constitutes a 'frame' containing unfilled 'roles'; by substituting 'fillers' for roles we generate filled-in stories.

For instance, the story

>*BEGIN Ava Sit down Ava Zane Say goodbye Abe Zane END Abe*

corresponds to the frame

>*BEGIN [subject] Sit down [subject] [friend] Say goodbye [subject] [friend] END*

In this example, the filler "Ava" corresponds to the role "subject", and "Zane" fills the role "friend".

The Coffee Shop World generator constructs a specified number of stories given a schema definition. For more details, see the [Coffee Shop World](https://github.com/PrincetonCompMemLab/narrative) repo. (We use a slightly modified version, available in a separate [repo](https://github.com/cchen23/narrative)).

### Experiments
We test networks' ability to perform role-filler binding, the ability to return the name of the filler corresponding to a queried role.

*Example input*: *BEGIN Alice Say_hi Alice Bob Order_drink Alice coffee Order_dessert Bob chocolate END Alice ? QSubject*

### Usage and Re-creating Experiments
See the [wiki](https://github.com/cchen23/generalized_schema_learning/wiki) for information about usage, re-creating specific experiments, and naming conventions.
